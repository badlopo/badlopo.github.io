> WIP

A flutter package, including components, implementations, helper functions and extensions. Designed to provide a simple way to develop with flutter.

**NOTE:** This library **completely** abandons semantics! (For example, `Container`+`GestureDetector` is used to express a `Button` rather than build-in ones) People who have related needs or care about this should use it with caution.
